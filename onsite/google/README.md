Questions asked during the onsite interview:

1. Problem was similar to this one. But the function interface was difference.
   But the idea was the same to apply union find data structure to solve the problem.

2. Given an <Iterator<Iterator\<K>> over the list of the format
```
   A -> B -> C -> D
   |    |    |    |
   V    V    V    V
   1    4    6    10
   |    |    |
   V    V    V
   2    5    7
   |         |
   V         V
   3         8
             |
             V
             9
```

Create class which implements iterator\<K> such that it iterates in the format.
```
1 -> 4 -> 6 -> 10 -> 2 -> 5 -> 7 -> 3 -> 8 -> 9
```
This is similar to this problem

I used high space approach to solve this problem. Not an optimal approach at all.

3. Given a list of nodes and their dependencies,

4. Currency

5. Tree with multi nodes.
